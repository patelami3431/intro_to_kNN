# kNN_Intro_ML

## Implemented kNN algorithm in C++ and compared the performance results with equivalent function in R.

The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, that does not “model” the data but instead it is highly based on the concept of “instance-based” or lazy-learning.  
For the project, the data used was iris data, which is a built-in R dataset. After the data exploration of iris data, it can be found the data frame has 150 instances and 5 variables. These 5 variables are namely, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width and Species. The variable Species has three levels, “setosa”, “versicolor” and “virginica,” with 50 observations in each level.
