# kNN Classification

### Implemented kNN algorithm in C++ and compared the performance results with equivalent function in R.

The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, that does not *model* the data but instead it is highly based on the concept of “instance-based” or lazy-learning.

For the project, the data used was `iris` data, which is a built-in R dataset. After the data exploration of `iris` data, it can be found:  
1. The data frame has 150 instances and 5 variables.   
2. These 5 variables are namely, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width and Species.   
3. The variable Species has three levels, __setosa__, __versicolor__ and __virginica__, with 50 observations in each level.
